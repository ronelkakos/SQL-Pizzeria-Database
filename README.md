# SQL Database for Pizzeria

(Created from September 2023 to December 2023)

In my groups database, we created a database that could be used for a pizzeria where it will be able to maintain and run a small pizzeria business. This database will help us to facilitate and be able to operate a small pizzeria place business very well and effectively with storing different entities. There are multiple different attributes that are involved such as customer information, employee information, ordering process, and much more.There is a PDF file that shows our group's model in the way we visualized the database before fully starting the SQL database so we could understand how the database can operate effectively. In Part 1 (Purple_Group_1 file), we created a database statement creating a database to store the tables. This included create table statements in all of the tables in our database, column names for all columns, data types for each column, not null constraints for certain columns, named primary key constraints, named foreign key constraints, named check and unique constraints where appropriate, and listed detailed comments explaining what the code is doing and who wrote it. Within the tables, I added data that is important to the database. In Part 2 (SQLQuery2 file), after I have added data in the tables, I queried it. In the file, there was queries that followed a list of having,

•	A WHERE clause
•	A multi-table join
•	A join with a set operator
•	A subquery
•	An outer join
•	A group by statement.
•	A having statement.

This database will help to handle all of the important aspects and business of running a small pizzeria. Overall, creating a SQL database was a great experience in getting hands-on learning knowledge on how databases operate and what is needed to run and efficiently operate a database.
